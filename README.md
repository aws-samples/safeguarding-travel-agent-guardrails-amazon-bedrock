This is the example notebook for the AWS blog [Blog link]().

In this example, we explore a solution for securing a virtual travel agent powered by generative AI. Demonstrating how to implement prompt engineering techniques, content moderation, and various guardrails to ensure the assistant operates within predefined boundaries by relying on Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock. Additionally, we implement a monitoring strategy to track the activation of the safeguards, enabling proactive identification and mitigation of potential issues.
